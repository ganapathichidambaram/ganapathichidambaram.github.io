## Introduction

Ensuring high availability and load balancing for MySQL is essential for maintaining a reliable and scalable database infrastructure. In this article, we will explore how to achieve high availability and load balancing for MySQL using Keepalived and HAProxy. Keepalived is a high availability monitor, while HAProxy acts as a load balancer. Together, they provide a robust solution for creating a high availability cluster for MySQL or any other application service.

We will assume the following configuration details for our setup:

* Virtual IP: 192.168.0.100
* Load Balancer Server 1 (loadb1): 192.168.0.25
* Load Balancer Server 2 (loadb2): 192.168.0.26 (for failover)
* App Server 1 (appserver1): 192.168.0.1
* App Server 2 (appserver2): 192.168.0.2

## Keepalived

Keepalived is a Linux Virtual Server that balances IP load across a set of real servers. It operates on a pair of equally configured computers: an active LVS router and a backup LVS router. Additionally, Keepalived uses Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP) to ensure network connectivity even if the default router fails.

### Keepalived Configuration

1. Install the Keepalived package on the load balancing server (loadb1), where HAProxy will run:

    ``` bash
    yum install keepalived
    ```
2. Backup the existing Keepalived configuration:

    ``` bash
    mv /etc/keepalived/keepalived.conf{,.back}
    vim /etc/keepalived/keepalived.conf
    ```

3. Configure the Keepalived using the following example configuration, based on your server's IP configuration:

    ``` bash
    global_defs {
        notification_email {
            user@mydomain.com
        }
        notification_email_from noreply@mydomain.com
        smtp_server 127.0.0.1
        smtp_connect_timeout 30
    }
    vrrp_instance VRRP1 {
        state MASTER
        interface eth0
        virtual_router_id 71
        priority 200
        advert_int 1
        authentication {
            auth_type PASS
            auth_pass 1234
        }
        virtual_ipaddress {
            192.168.0.100
        }
    }
    ```
4. Edit the /etc/sysctl.conf file to enable the non-local IP binding:

    ``` bash
    vi /etc/sysctl.conf
    ```
  Add the following line:

    ``` bash
    net.ipv4.ip_nonlocal_bind=1
    ```

5. Restart the Keepalived daemon and enable it to start on boot:

    ``` bash
    systemctl restart keepalived
    systemctl enable keepalived
    ```
  Now, the load balancer server (loadb1) will have the virtual IP address assigned to its physical network interface.


## Backup Load Balancer (Failover)

To configure a backup load balancer server (loadb2) for failover, follow the same steps as above but use the following configuration

  ``` bash
  global_defs {
      notification_email {
          user@mydomain.com
      }
      notification_email_from noreply@mydomain.com
      smtp_server 127.0.0.1
      smtp_connect_timeout 30
  }
  vrrp_instance VRRP1 {
      state BACKUP
      interface eth0
      virtual_router_id 71
      priority 100
      advert_int 1
      authentication {
          auth_type PASS
          auth_pass 1234
      }
      virtual_ipaddress {
          192.168.0.100
      }
  }
  ```

The backup load balancer server (loadb2) will assign the virtual IP address to its network interface only when the master load balancer becomes unreachable.

## HAProxy
HAProxy is a high availability load balancer that ensures efficient distribution of traffic among multiple servers. It is installed on the load balancing servers (loadb1 and loadb2).

### HAProxy Configuration

1. Install the HAProxy package:

    ``` bash
    yum install haproxy
    ```

2. Backup the default HAProxy configuration:

    ``` bash
    mv /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg{,.back}
    ```

3. Create a new HAProxy configuration file with the following content:

    ``` bash
    global
        user haproxy
        group haproxy

    defaults
        mode http
        log global
        retries 2
        timeout connect 3000ms
        timeout server 5000ms
        timeout client 5000ms

    listen stats
        bind 192.168.0.100:9999
        stats enable
        stats hide-version
        stats uri /stats
        stats auth statadmin:statadminpass

    listen mysql-cluster
        bind 192.168.0.100:3306
        mode tcp
        option mysql-check user haproxy_check
        balance roundrobin
        server mysql-1 192.168.0.1:3306 check
        server mysql-2 192.168.0.2:3306 check
    ```

4. Before starting HAProxy, create a user on each MySQL server for health checks. This user should be created without a password

    ``` bash
    mysql -u root -p
    MariaDB> CREATE USER 'haproxy_check'@'%';
    MariaDB> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
    ```

5. Restart the HAProxy service and enable it to start on boot:

    ``` bash
    systemctl restart haproxy
    systemctl enable haproxy
    ```

Now, HAProxy is configured to balance the traffic across the MySQL servers (appserver1 and appserver2) using the virtual IP address.

## Conclusion

In this article, we have explored how to achieve high availability and load balancing for MySQL using Keepalived and HAProxy. By configuring Keepalived to monitor and manage the virtual IP address, and setting up HAProxy as a load balancer, we can ensure a reliable and scalable MySQL cluster. This setup provides failover capabilities and efficient distribution of traffic, resulting in improved availability and performance for your MySQL-based applications.
